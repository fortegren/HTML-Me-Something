                <p>Hi, Y'all! I'm Francesca. I'm originally from Texas--born in San Antonio, then lived in Austin and DFW for a few years. When I graduated high school, I moved to Lubbock, TX, where I lived until I got married in 2014.</p>
                <p>My husband, Marco, and I just built an amazing forever-home with our two dogs, Mason <img src="images/masoncorn.jpg" alt="Dog eating corn" width="140"> and Auggie <img src="images/auggiecorn.jpg" alt="Dog eating corn" width="140"></p>

                <h2>Education, Career, and Future</h2>
                    <p>In Lubbock, I attended Texas Tech University, where I earned a BA, MA, and PhD in Experimental Psychology. While I was working on my dissertation, I got married here in St. Louis, moved to Carbondale, IL for a year [while my husband worked at SIU], then took a job in Evansville, IN at Southern Indiana University for three years. This year, I moved to the St. Louis area. I currently teach psychology at McKendree University.</p>

                    <p>My trainig is in experimental psychology with a focus on cognition. Particularly how people regulate their own study behaviors to learn new information, how people think about their own learning, and how educators can help students become more efficient learners. </p>
                    <p>My career, however, has been more focused on teaching than on research (which wasn't my plan, just the way it worked out with the two-academic household). While I enjoy aspects of what I do, my real interests lie in programming (the "logic" and problem-solving really speak to me) and data science. I think data science--particularly machine learning and artificial intelligence--are changing the way we interact with the world. The area of data science involves also my nerdy love of statistics and likely some "teaching" or communicating numbers to people, which I love (I just don't love teaching them how to do it themselves haha).</p> </article>

                <h2>Things I Love</h2>
                    <p>I <em>love</em> being outside in the sun. These overcast Midwest skies are pretty lame, but I'm trying to embrace the seasons...or at least tolerate them ;). As part of my outdoor adventures, I like to run with my pups, hike, and backpack (although I don't do much of the latter two anymore).</p>
                    <p>I also absolutely love traveling to new places, wandering new cities, being in the mountains, and drinking beer (in the summer...I'm more of a Cabernet or bourbon girl in the winter). </p>

                    <p>Strangely, I like cleaning. Not being tidy, per se, but just spending a day really scrubbing down the house. It's pretty cathartic for me.</p>
                    <p>Since I moved to the Midwest, I've gotten back into my childhood hobby of sketching and painting. Spending time being creative is a way to relax and have a bit of fun without "thinking" or interacting with people, but I rarely finish anything I started!</p>
